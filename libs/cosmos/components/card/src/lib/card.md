# Cards

Cards are used as a container for groups of related information. With so many different types of information to surface for Encore's products, it is important to clearly separate one group of elements from another.

## When to use cards

Any combination of icons, text, buttons, images, status indicators that are related and represent a single unit, should use a card to group them. Cards can be used for grouping products, categories, contact information, etc.

## How it works

When using cards, correct spacing around and in between the elements it contains is required. This specific sizing varies depending on the elements that are included.

Generally, container and action cards should be placed on a surface with White or Pearl Backgrounds.
