# Accessibility

Components in the Cosmos pattern library must comply with [WCAG 2 Level AA](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) accessibility standards.

## Guidelines

- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Quick Reference](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)
- [Accessible Rich Internet Application Markup (ARIA)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php)

## How to Test Accessibility

Developers & QA testers should perform manual & automated accessibility tests on each component before integrating them into an application. The following are some first steps to testing:

- **Verify basic keyboard accessibility**

  A person will be able to use their keyboard to navigate through content in a logical order as well as interact with UI elements. The active focused element will be clearly indicated at all times when navigating the site with the keyboard.

  For more information, see [WebAIM's Keyboard Accessibility recommendations](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)

- **Perform manual and automated accessibility testing on compiled HTML**

  The [aXe browser extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/axe-for-web/) for Chrome or Firefox is a good choice for this testing. It is also available as a library that integrates with automated testing scripts.

- **Perform manual and automated color accessibility testing**

  Certain combinations of colors are difficult to see for people with various visual disabilities. Look for obvious instances of this and then use automated processes to find the rest.

  Again, the [aXe browser extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/axe-for-web/) for Chrome or Firefox is a good choice of tool for color contrast testing.

- **Test manually with screen readers**

  Ensure that the site's content is announced correctly and can be navigated using screen readers. Use [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) (with Firefox) and/or [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) (with Internet Explorer) on Windows as the primary tools for this testing.

  Use [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1124.html) for doing screen reader testing on a Mac, though NVDA and JAWS on Windows are preferred.

- **Ensure appropriate use of ARIA attributes**

  Use (ARIA attributes)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA] as needed to support, but not replace, semantic HTML. ARIA is particularly helpful in support of dynamic content and advanced UI controls. See Using [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/) in HTML for more information.

Here are some tools that might help you during testing:

- [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- [Tenon (website URL audit)](https://tenon.io/)
- [Wave (chrome extension)](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
- [Color Contrast Analyzer (chrome extension)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-contrast-analyzer/dagdlcijhfbmgkjokkjicnnfimlebcll)
- [checkmycolours](http://www.checkmycolours.com/)
- aXe ([chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en) | [module](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core))
- [pa11y](http://pa11y.org/) ([CLI](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y) | [CI](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci))

## Storybook Accessibility Addon

[@storybook/addon-a11y](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/a11y) is included in the project to show developers (and other team members) all the accessibility rule violations & passes for each component. In the Storybook UI, you can view the results of the addon's audit in the right-hand panel. Including this addon means that developers can validate the accessibility of the components they're building _as they're building them_. This helps make sure we are
