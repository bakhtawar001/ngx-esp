# Visual Regression Testing

Visual regression tests help catch unintentional changes to the visual rendering of a web page or component. As engineers and testers, we already do this manually, but it takes a lot of time, and as humans, are prone to overlooking breaking changes. Automating this process gives us back time to focus on more important things, and gives us added confidence when updating code.

## System Requirements

The following should be installed globally on your machine

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/)

## About Visual Regression Testing

These tests are run in headless Chrome using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/). They are written using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) testing framework. [jest-puppeteer](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer) is added to facilitate writing and running the tests, and [jest-image-snapshot](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot) does the actual image comparison and lets us know when something has changed.

Each test will load a page in the browser, perform necessary UI interactions, and then take a screenshot of the entire page or a specific element on the page. The screenshot file is saved alongside the test file and committed to source control. The next time the tests run, this image is used as a reference and compared against a current screenshot. If any differences between the two images are detected, the test will fail, and an image containing the diff is created and saved alongside the original reference screenshot.

We run the tests in a Docker container to ensure there are no differences between local and CI environments. These tests should not be run on a developer's native OS because minor rendering differences between operating systems in the browser will cause test failures.

## Writing tests

Test files must follow the naming pattern `*.vis.test.js` and reside in the same folder as their component's source files. Tests are written using Jest and Puppeteer. A number of globals (e.g. browser and page) are made available by jest-puppeteer to reduce the amount of setup and teardown code required for each test. In addition, common utility methods are also defined in `visual-tests/jest-setup.js` that can be imported and used within tests.

As a basic example, here is how you would write a test that takes a screenshot of a specific page and expects that it matches an existing reference screenshot.

```
// landing.test.vis.js
describe('landing page', () => {
  const { loadPage, matchBodyScreenshot } = global.utils;

  test('should render correctly', async () => {
    await loadPage(url);
    await matchPageScreenshot();
  });
});
```
