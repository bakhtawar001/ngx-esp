### When to use this component

Use images when looking to display a product or product related features (colors, styles, variations). Also can be used to set the tone of the page in the form of an Hero Image.



## How it works

#### Size appropriately

To best display images of different sizes and types, appropriately size images for different displays and platforms. Resolution is the most important factor in how to best display images of different sizes and types, appropriately size images for different displays and platforms. Resolution is the most important factor in how quickly imagery will load. To preserve network bandwidth, keep resolution low where possible.



#### Alternative text

To ensure accessibility, imagery should include alternative text (or a caption) to be read by screen readers for users with visual impairments. Without alternative text, screen reader users just hear the word "image,‚Äù without any visual details.



#### Placement Imagery + Text

Elements like text or actions may be placed to the right of images.



#### Small

#### Standard

#### Large

#### Hero Image

#### Image Carousel
