# Date Picker

Date pickers allow a user to choose a single date to be stored within the Projector PSA app.

### When to use a Date Picker

- When a date needs to be selected and stored within the app
- When a user needs to move a selected date to another date


## How it works

### General

- Only a single date can be selected
- A date picker is presented within a contextual modal and is triggered by a select control or button.
- Today's date is selected by default
- Users can select a different date by click a date within the calendar picker

### Actions

- Users can navigate by clicking the previous or next buttons to different months/years
- Users can navigate to specific Months & Years by interacting with the select controls
- Users can remove any date selection with "Clear Date" button
- Users can reset the picker to current day with "Today" button


## Visual Details

### Typography

- The label for each date is Body 14 Regular (Foreground Primary)

- The label for each date outside of the current month is Body 14 Regular (Foreground Tertiary)
- To show a focused state use a 2px (#0F8BFF) border.
