// This library won't have tests. Don't import anything here and keep that file empty,
// since `@cosmos/testing/setup` will use that library to define global injections.
// This will cause a circular dependency between these libraries:
// Error: Circular dependency between "cosmos-ng-event-plugins" and "cosmos-testing" detected:
